Module Eight Journal: DriverPass Project Reflection
1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was designed for a client that provides online driver's education services. The client requested a system that would allow users to register for the program, access learning modules, schedule driving lessons with instructors, and track progress toward obtaining a driver’s license. The system needed to be user-friendly and capable of supporting interactions between customers, instructors, administrators, and the DMV.

2. What did you do particularly well?
I was particularly successful in translating the client’s needs into a clear set of system requirements and functional use cases. I also created detailed and accurate UML diagrams that captured the essential components and behaviors of the system.

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revisit the system design document to expand on non-functional requirements, such as performance expectations and usability considerations. Adding more specific examples and metrics would improve clarity and future scalability.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I reviewed the transcript and requirements to understand user goals and pain points, then used that information to define features and workflows. Considering the user’s needs is crucial—it ensures the system solves real problems and provides a smooth experience, which ultimately leads to user satisfaction and system success.

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I use a structured approach starting with requirement gathering, followed by use case development, system modeling (with UML), and iterative feedback. In the future, I plan to apply Agile techniques to allow for faster prototyping and more flexible responses to user feedback throughout the development cycle.
